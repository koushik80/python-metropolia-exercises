#E2.2
#Problem:
#Define two variables and assign them values of 1000 and 24. After this,
#make the interpreter do the calculation number1+number2+15 and then take the 2nd exponent (**2) of the result.
#Save this final result to a new variable,
#and make the program print the result in the following way:
#The final results of the calculation was: 1079521
#Solution:

number1 = 1000
number2 = 24
number3 = number1 + number2
print("The final results of the calculation was:",(number3 + 15)**2)
