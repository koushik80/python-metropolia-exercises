#E-5.3: Filtering the file contents
#Problem: In the third program, we take a look into the classification of file contents.
#In the same directory with the source code is a file "strings.txt",
# which has random strings in several lines.
# The lines can be divided into two groups:
# those which only have letters (a-z, A-Z) and numbers (0-9), and those which also have random special characters (?,&,@, $ ...).

# Create a program which reads all of the lines from the file and tests the lines.
# If the line has only letters and/or numbers, the program prints "[line] was ok.".
# If the line has special characters, the program should print "[line] was invalid.".
# When the program works, it prints out something like this:

              # >>>
              #5345m345รถ34l was ok.
              #no2no123non4 was ok.
              #noq234n5ioqw  # % was invalid.
              #%  # ""SGMSGSER was invalid.
              #doghdp5234 was ok.
              #sg, dermoepm was invalid.
              #43453-frgsd was invalid.
              #hsth())) was invalid.
              #bmepm35wae was ok.
              #vmopaem2234+0 + was invalid.
              #gsdm12313 was ok.
              #bbrbwb55be3"?"  # ? was invalid.
              #"?"  # %#"!%#"&"?%%"?#?#"?" was invalid.
              #retrte  # %#?% was invalid.
              #abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvxy was ok.
              #>>>
#Hints:
#It is advisable to read the lines one at a time,
# test them with the isalmun() string test and go on from there.
# Also remember that the strings may also end in a line break (\n),
# which is allowed, but fails the .isalnum() test if not sliced away.

#Solution

file = open("strings.txt", "r")
content = file.readlines()

for i in content:
    i = i[:-1]
    if i.isalnum() == True:
        print(i, "was ok.")
    else:
        print(i, "was invalid.")

file.close()
