#E-2.1
#Problem: The objective is to create a variable by giving it the correct name,
#and assign it the string "string-type content" as a value.
#Then insert this variable into a print command so that the program prints out following text:
#Our variable has a value which is string-type content. Isn't that nice?
#Solution: 

x = "string-type content"
print("Our variable has a value which is"+x+"."+"Isn't that nice?")
