#E2.4-Using layout characters
#Problem:
#In this program the objective is to understand how the layout-characters (\t and \n} and print in general works.
#By using only the print command, make the interpreter to print out the following text:

#This here is divided to several lines:
#I am still in the same print-command.
         #Name:	Peter
         #Job:	Babysitter
#Solution:


print("This here is divided to several lines:\n", "I am still in the same print-command.\n", "Name:\t Peter\n"
      "Job:\t Babysitter")
