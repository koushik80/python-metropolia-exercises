#E-6.1: Basic subfunction

#Problem:Create a program with a main function and a separate subfunction called hello,
#which when called prints "Hello there!".
#The subfunction does not take any parameters or return any value, just prints the line.
#Then, to the main function, add a call to the subfunction and two print commands,
#the first one before the call which says "Lets call the subfunction:", and one after the subfunction call,
#a print command which prints "Quitting.".
#If implemented correctly, the program will print the following:

            #Lets call the subfunction:
            #Hello there!
            #Quitting.

#Also remember to add this main function call to the main level:

           #if __name__ == "__main__":
                #main()

#Solution:

def main():
    print("Lets call the subfunction:")
    hello()

def hello():
    print("Hello there!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

print("Quitting.")
